# Instrument Existing Agent With Prefactor SDK

Instrument a working agent that was built without Prefactor.

Core principle: instrument boundaries, not business logic.

## Quick Start

1. Bootstrap Prefactor resources with `skills/bootstrap-existing-agent-with-prefactor-cli/SKILL.md`.
2. Install required Prefactor packages with the project's existing package manager (`bun`, `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`).
3. Identify runtime path: built-in adapter (`@prefactor/langchain`, `@prefactor/ai`, `@prefactor/openclaw`) or custom `@prefactor/core` adapter.
4. Add one top-level run span and child spans around LLM/tool boundaries.
5. Preserve context propagation and package-prefixed span types.
6. Record error metadata and rethrow original errors.
7. Finish spans on success, error, cancel, and stream terminal paths.
8. Verify in your project's build/test/typecheck flow.

## Prerequisite

Before instrumentation, ensure these runtime credentials are set from CLI bootstrap output:

- `PREFACTOR_API_URL`
- `PREFACTOR_API_TOKEN`
- `PREFACTOR_AGENT_ID`

Use the created `agent_id` for `PREFACTOR_AGENT_ID`.

Also ensure dependencies are installed from npm via the project's package manager:

- `@prefactor/cli`
- one of `@prefactor/langchain`, `@prefactor/ai`, `@prefactor/openclaw`
- `@prefactor/core` only when no built-in adapter is available

## Coding Tool Trigger Phrases

If the user asks for any of these, apply this skill:

- "instrument this existing agent"
- "this agent already works, add prefactor tracing"
- "wrap this existing langchain/ai agent with prefactor"
- "add tracing for tool calls and runs"
- "tool calls are missing in my coding tool timeline"

## Use With Custom Provider Skill

Sometimes you need both skills.

- If the framework/provider is already supported by a Prefactor adapter, use this skill directly.
- If the framework/provider is not supported yet, first use `skills/create-provider-package-with-core/SKILL.md` to build a custom adapter, then use this skill to instrument the existing agent with that adapter.

Recommended sequence when unsupported:

1. Create provider adapter with `@prefactor/core`.
2. Integrate adapter into the existing agent entrypoint.
3. Validate run/llm/tool/error spans in real executions.

## Implementation Rules

- Prefer built-in adapters before low-level `@prefactor/core`:
  - LangChain -> `@prefactor/langchain`
  - AI SDK -> `@prefactor/ai`
  - OpenClaw -> `@prefactor/openclaw`
- If a built-in adapter does not exist, follow `skills/create-provider-package-with-core/SKILL.md`.
- Keep provider span types package-prefixed (`langchain:*`, `ai-sdk:*`, `openclaw:*`).
- Run nested work inside active context so parent/child trace trees stay intact.
- Capture input/output safely (redact secrets, enforce truncation limits).
- Instrumentation must never crash user code.

## Verification

Run equivalent project verification commands (for example build, typecheck, and tests).

Also run at least one real agent request and confirm:

- top-level run span exists
- child llm/tool spans are correctly nested
- terminal status appears for success and failure

- For an execution checklist and failure diagnostics, read `references/instrumentation-checklist.md`.

## Common Mistakes

- Instrumenting every helper instead of boundaries.
- Using generic span types.
- Swallowing exceptions after logging.
- Missing stream cancel/error completion paths.
